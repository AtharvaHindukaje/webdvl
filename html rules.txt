insert ! for boiler plate in vs code for html skeleton

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

doctype html states that document is written in html because there are many other documents which browser understands
head has all meta tags which describe the website
meta means information about information
body contains info about webpage
ctrl+/ for comment
charset = utf8 means the characters utf8 will be used
viewport encourages the responsive design set width equal to device width
ie tag is for ie using people...full form is internet explorer.. ie=edge means jo sabse highest compatibility mode hai usme display karo
we need to add two more meta tags   <meta name="description" content="This is a description"> and   <meta name="keywords" content="python, python tutorials">
when we want that our website should not appear on search engine <meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"> otherwise write INDEX and FOLLOW
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="harry.css"> to link stylesheet
<script src="harry.js"></script> to link javascript (note that you need to type script:src not just script for boiler plate)
you should only use one h1 tag in code to reduce seo of page...donnt use it to make bold
lorem 4 to insert 4 words 
strong tag makes the content bold
em tag (not emp)  is emphasis tag by default it makes the text italic but we can change the attribute
bold and italic tag exist but not used as strong and em tag are newer versions
br tag is a self closing tag used to add line break...using br is not a good practice 
hr tag is also a self closing tag called horizontal rule adds a line
ctrl+enter will take you to new line start without using mouse
<a href="www.google.com" target="_blank"></a>          target="_blank" makes you open the link in new tab instead loading on same tab..
<a href="/index.html" target="_blank"></a> using slash and file name will open it when clicked on anchor text....
